    <p>What are my roadblocks</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I have been sick. 
            It has been a rough term for me. I have been sick twice 
            and both times for multiple weeks.
        </li>
        <li>My wife and daughter are both working from how so internet 
            has been crashing constantly.
        </li>
        <li>Hard to focus with my wife doing her online meetings for work 
            and school.
        </li>
        <li>Grandson has been home all day since day care is closed. His mom 
            is working and so is my wife, so he keeps coming to me. Working with 
            a baby in my lap (trying to help type) has been a stuggle.
        </li>

    </ol>
