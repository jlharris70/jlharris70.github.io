        <h2>The Window Object</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Browser Object Model</h3>
            <p>
                The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties 
                and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. 
               <ul> 
                    <li>which browser is being used </li>
                    <li>find out the dimensions of the screen</li>
                    <li>which pages have been visited before</li>
                    <li>creating pop-up windows</li>
                </ul>
                <span style="font-style: italic;">* There is no official standard for the BOM</span>
            <br><br>
            The <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.location</span> 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">property </span> is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. 
            It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments 
            of the URL.
            <ul>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.location.href</li>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.location.protocol</li>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.location.host</li>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.location.hostname</li>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.location.port</li>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.location.pathname</li>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.location.search</li>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.location.hash</li>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.location.origin</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            The <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.location</span> 
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">object </span> also has the following methods:
            <ul>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">reload()</li>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">assign()</li>
                <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">replace()</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Browser History</h3>
            <p>
                The<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> window.history </span> 
                 property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the 
                 current browser session.
            </p>
            <h3>Controling Windows</h3>
            <p>
                A new window can be opened using the 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.open() </span>
                 method. This takes the URL of the page to be opened as its first 
                 parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of 
                 attributes as the third parameter.
                 <ul>
                    <li>The <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">close() </span> 
                        method can be used to close a window, assuming you have a reference to it: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <br><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">popup.close() </span>
                        </ul> <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>It is also possible to move a window using the 
                         <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.moveTo() </span> 
                         method. 
                    </li>
                    <li>You can resize a window using the  
                        <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.resizeTo() </span> 
                        method. 
                   </li>
                 </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Document Object</h3>
            <p>
                Each 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window </span> 
                object contains a 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">document </span> 
                object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page 
                been loaded into the window.
                <br><br>
                The  
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">document </span> 
                object contains a few other methods:
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">document.write()</li>
                    This method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already 
                    loaded, it will completely replace the current document
                </ul> 

            </p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were 
            invented by Netscape as a way of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol. 
            This means that a browser does not remember anything from one request to another. 
            So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is 
            remembered. Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information 
            that can then be retrieved between requests.
            <br><br>
            A restriction of cookies is that they can only be read by a web page from the same
             domain that set them. This is to stop sites being able to access information 
             about users, such as other sites they have visited. Cookies are also limited 
             to storing up to 4KB of data, although 20 cookies are allowed per domain, which
              can add up to quite a lot of data.
            <br><br>
            Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, s
            toring user preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping 
            cart), authentication and tracking users. The use of cookies for tracking 
            purposes has been much maligned in recent years. Their use for data storage 
            is starting to be replaced in many cases by the new HTML5 localStorage API 
            as it allows more data to be stored. This is covered in Chapter 14. Cookies 
            are still useful for retaining state information (such as if a user is logged 
            in) because they’re passed between the client and server on every HTTP request.
            <br><br>
            Cookies take the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value 
            pairs separated by semicolons.

            <h4>Creating Cookies</h4>
            To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar”, using the 
            <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">document.cookie </span> 
            property.
            <br>
            The property acts like a special type of string. Assigning another cookie to it won’t 
            overwrite the entire property, it will just append it to the end of the string.

            <h4>Changing Cookies</h4>
            A cookie’s value can be changed by reassigning it to
            <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">document.cookie </span>
             using the same name but a different value.

            <h4>Reading Cookies</h4>
            To see the current contents of the cookie jar, simply enter 
            <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">document.cookie</span>
            <br>We can use the 
            <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">split </span>
            method to break the string into an array containing each 
            name/value pair, then use a 
            <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">for of loop </span>
            to iterate through the array

            <h4>Cookie Epiry Dates</h4>
            Cookies are session cookies by default. This means they are deleted once 
            a browser session is finished (when the user closes the browser tab or 
            window). Cookies can be made persistent ― that is, lasting beyond the 
            browser session ― by adding 
            <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">"; expires=date"</span>
             to the end of the cookie when 
            it’s set, where date is a date value in the UTC String format 
            <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Day, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT</span> . 
            <br><br>
            <span style="color: red">NOTE: Applications that contain sensitive 
                information shouldn’t rely on cookies expiring using these methods. 
                Browsers can sometimes hold on to information stored in a cookie that
                 should have expired when the “session restore” feature is used after 
                 a crash.</span>

            <h4>Deleting Cookies</h4>
            <p>
                To remove a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a time in the past
            </p>

            <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
            <p>
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">setTimeout()</span>
                <br><br>
                The 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window</span> 
                object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution 
                of a function, and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals.
                <br><br>
                The 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.setTimeout()</span> 
                method accepts a callback to a function as its first 
                parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.

                <br><br>
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">setInterval()</span>
                <br><br>
                The 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.setInterval()</span> 
                method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout() , except that 
                it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given 
                number of milliseconds.
                <br>
                *These methods can be used to animate elements on a web page.
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">requestAnimationFrame()</span>
                <br><br>
                This method works in much the same way as the
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window.setInterval()</span>
                 method, although it has a number of improvements to optimize its 
                 performance. These include making the most of the browser’s 
                 built-in graphics-handling capabilities, and not running the 
                 animation when the tab is inactive, resulting in a much smoother 
                 performance.
                 <br><br>
                 In general, it is typically better to use CSS for any animation effects, although 
                 there may be times when JavaScript might be the better solution.
            </p>
        </ul>
        
        <br>

        <h2>HML5</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">data </span>attribute</h3>
            <p>
                This is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes 
                that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so 
                are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole 
                purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. This means they’re 
                perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program 
                utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page.
                <br><br>
                The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but 
                they must use the following format:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Start with 
                        <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">data-</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores</li>
                    <li>Include an optional string value</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ul><ul>
                    data-powers = 'flight superSpeed'<br>
                    data-rating = '5' <br>
                    data-dropdown<br>
                    data-user = 'DAZ'<br> 
                    data-max-length = '32'<br>
                </ul></ul>
                <br>
                Each element has a 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">dataset property</span>
                that can be used to access any 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">data-</span> 
                attributes it contains. Here’s an example of some markup:
                <ul>
                    <code>
                        < div id='hero' data-powers='flight superSpeed'><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Superman <br>
                    < /div>
                    </code>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">data-powers </span>
                attribute can be accessed using the following code:
                <ul>
                    <code>
                        const superman = document.getElementById('hero');<br>
                        const powers = superman.dataset.powers;<br>
                        << 'flight superSpeed'<br>
                    </code>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </ul>

        
        <h2>HML5 APIs</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>
                The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to 
                gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation,
                    and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are 
                    frequently introduced to give developers access, and control new 
                    features that appear in the latest devices.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>HTML5 Web Storage</h3>
            <p>
                The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s 
                computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, 
                more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it 
                perfect for storing information about users, as well as storing 
                application-specific information that can then be used during future 
                sessions.
                <br><br>
                The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:
                <ul>
                    <li>Information stored isnotshared with the server on every request</li>
                    <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only 
                        if the domain is the same).

                    </li>
                    <li>torage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There 
                        is no actual limit in 
                        the specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.)</li>
                    <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This 
                        potentially makes 
                        cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">window</span>
                 
                object will have
                 a property called 
                 <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">localStorage</span>
                  
                 , which is a native object with a 
                 number of properties and methods used to store data. The information 
                 is saved in the form of key-value pairs, and the values can only be 
                 strings. There is also a 
                 <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">sessionStorage</span>
                 
                  object that works in the same
                  way, although the data is only saved for the current session.
                <br><br>
                  <ul>
                      <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">localStorage.setItem()</li>
                      <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">localStorage.getItem()</li>
                      <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">localStorage.name = ""</li>
                      <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">localStorage.removeItem()</li>
                      <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">localStorage.clear()</li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  Every time a value is saved to local storage, a 
                  <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">storage</span>
                   
                  event is fired. Note that this event is only fired on any 
                  <span style="font-style: italic;">other</span>
                   
                  windows or tabs from the same domain, and only if the value of the 
                  item being saved changes. The event object sent by the event 
                  listener to the callback has a number of properties that provide 
                  information about the updated item:
                  <br><br>
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                        <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">key</span>
                        tells us the key of the item that changed
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">newValue</span>
                        tells us the new value to which it has been changed
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">oldValue</span>
                        tells us the previous value before it was changed
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">storageArea</span>
                        tells us if it is stored in local or session storage.
                      </li>
                  </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Geolocation</h3>
            <p>
                The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the 
                device. This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, 
                then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is 
                moving. This information can then be used to filter data based on the 
                user's location or speed and direction of travel. An example of this 
                might be a search function that returns results based on your location.
                 Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be granted 
                 by the user first.
                <br><br>
                If geolocation is available, it will be a property of the navigator 
                object that we met in Chapter 9. This property has a method called 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">getCurrentPosition() </span>
                
                that will return a 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">position</span>
                 
                object to a specified 
                callback function, called 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">youAreHere()</span>
                 
                in the example:
                <br>
                <code>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);
                </code>
                <br><br>
                The position object passed to the 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">youAreHere()</span>
                 
                function has a 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">coords</span>
                 
                property with a 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">latitude</span>
                 
                and 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">longitude</span>
                 
                property, which together give the coordinates of the device. These 
                coordinates can then be used in conjunction with other applications 
                or web services (such as a mapping service) to obtain the user’s exact
                 location. In this example, we simply show an alert dialog that 
                 displays the user’s coordinates:
            </p>

            <h3>Web Workers</h3>
            <p>
                Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for 
                concurrency in JavaScript. The idea is that any processes that could take a 
                long time are carried out in the background, so a website will continue to 
                function without fear of the dreaded 'script has become unresponsive' message 
                that occurs when a script runs for too long

                <br><br>
                To get started, use the 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Worker()</span>
                 
                constructor function to create a new worker
            </p>

            <h3>Shared Web Workers</h3>
            <p>
                The examples we have seen so far are known as dedicated web workers. 
                These are linked to the script that loaded the worker, and are unable 
                to be used by another script. You can also create shared web workers 
                that allow lots of different scripts on the same domain to access the 
                same worker object
            </p>

            <h3>Service Workers</h3>
            <p>
                The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background 
                with the added benefit of being able to intercept network requests. This 
                allows you to take alternative action if the network is offline, and 
                effectively create app-like offline experiences. Service workers also 
                allow access to push notifications and background syncing. Service workers 
                require a secure network to run on HTTPS to avoid any malicious code 
                hijacking network requests.
            </p>

            <h3>Web Sockets</h3>
            <p>
                Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a 
                server – also known as push messaging. This means that a connection 
                is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they 
                are received.
            </p>

            <h3>Notifications</h3>
            <p>
                The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's 
                notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner of the screen,
                but it changes depending on the operating system. An advantage of 
                using the system notification is that they will still be displayed 
                even if the web page that calls them isn't the current tab.
                <br><br>
                Before you can send notifications, you need to get permission granted 
                by the user. This can be achieved using the requestPermission() method
                 of a Notification global object. 
            </p>

            <h3>Multimedia</h3>
            <p>
                An audio clip can be inserted into a page with the 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">< audio > </span>
                    tag, using the 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">src</span>
                    attribute to point to the audio file
                <br><br>
                A video clip can be inserted with the 
                <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">< video ></video></span>
                 tag, using the 
                 <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">src</span>     
                attribute to point to the movie file
                <br><br>
                Audio and video elements have a number of properties and 
                methods to control the playback of the clip.
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">video.play();</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">video.pause();</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">video.volume = 0.9;</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">video.muted = true;</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">video.currentTime += 10; // jumps forward 10 seconds</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">video.playbackRate = 8; // fast-forward at 8 times as fast</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">video.loop = true;</li>
                    <li style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">video.duration;</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Other APIs</h3>
                <p>
                    The list of APIs is constantly growing, and includes APIs for 
                    accessing a device’s camera, uploading files, accessing the 
                    battery status, handling push notifications, building drag-and-drop
                     functionality, creating 3D effects with WebGL, and many more! A 
                     comprehensive list of HTML5 APIs can be found at the Mozilla 
                     Developer Network.
                </p>
                <h3>Drawing shapes with canvas</h3>
                <p>
                    The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn 
                    onto a web page in real time using JavaScript. A canvas element 
                    is a rectangular element on the web page. It has a coordinate 
                    system that starts at (0,0) in the top-left corner. 
                </p>
                <h3>Shims and Polyfills</h3>
                <p>
                    Shim and polyfill comes in handy. These are libraries of code 
                    that allow you to use the APIs as usual. They then fill in the 
                    necessary code that's not provided natively by the user’s browser.
                    <br><br>
                    The terms shim and polyfill are often used interchangeably. The main
                     difference between them is that a shim is a piece of code that adds
                      some missing functionality to a browser, although the 
                      implementation method may differ slightly from the standard API.
                    <br><br>
                    A polyfill is a shim that achieves the same functionality, while also 
                    using the API commands that would be used if the feature was supported natively.
