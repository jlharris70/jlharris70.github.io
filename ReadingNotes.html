    <h1>Doing Stuff with Web Things notes:</h1>
    <p>This feels mostly like review.<br><br>
        Previously I was using 'div' to divide up my code, should I be using 'section' instead?
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is one a newer version of the other or are they different and I should be using both?</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        localStorage – Uses key-value pairs (An associative array)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If it is just an array, isn’t it just like any other variable?</li>
        <li>Can it be accessed by any function? (global)</li>
        <li>How/When is this cleaned up?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The examples have 'script' withing 'head'. 
        I feel like in a previous class we were told
         to put it at the end, just before '/body because 
         the page would load faster since it didn’t have to 
         read all of the js before loading.  
         [What is best practice here?]

    <p><strong>*Not to myselfe:</strong></p>
    <p>
        1. rounded corners look nicer on buttons, start using border-radius (not sure on input boxes though)<br>
        2. box-shadow (outside is default) use ‘inset’ for inside box shadow.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shadow outside makes button (or input) look higher than the rest of the document</li>
        <li>Shadow inset makes button (or input) look lower than the rest of the document</li>
    </ul>
